    <h2>Ego Jinpachi’s Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Ego Jinpachi’s philosophy in Blue Lock is built on the belief that true greatness in football is born from overwhelming selfishness rather than teamwork alone. He rejects the traditional Japanese football mindset of harmony and self-sacrifice, arguing that a striker’s sole purpose is to score goals, even if it means betraying teammates or destroying existing strategies. Ego teaches that the world’s best striker must possess an unbreakable ego — the confidence to declare oneself the protagonist of the match and the hunger to dominate every moment. Through extreme competition, psychological pressure, and survival-based selection, Blue Lock forces players to confront their own limits and desires, pushing them to evolve by discarding fear, hesitation, and reliance on others. According to Ego, only those who embrace their individuality, weaponize their unique skills, and are willing to shoulder all responsibility for victory can rise to the top, because football at its highest level rewards those who can impose their will on the game and decide its outcome with their own hands — or rather, their own goals.
